### The project 

Ohmyfood is a young online meal ordering startup. It is specialized in gastronomic restaurants menus.
Their concept : allow plateform users to compose their own menus in advance. And so, decrease the waiting times in restaurants.
The startup has already developed this concept in New-York and now wishes to export it to Paris.

For the first stage of this project, the goal was to have a first web site working version with CSS animations and responsive design.
